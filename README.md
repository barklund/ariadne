This is a for best-practice implementations of various common HTML patterns with a strong focus on recommendation from WCAG, WAI-ARIA and W3.

This repository includes a number of patterns, for each a number of variants, and for each an implementation in popular web frameworks.

## Definitions and choices

### Patterns and variants

The patterns are loosely based on the 27 defined patterns in WAI-ARIA's best practice document.

The variants are different versions of various optional parts of the patterns. There will also be a bare-bones variant that includes as little as possible and a most-common variant, that represents the most commonly used features of said pattern. Not all combinations of optional patterns will be documented as variants. These two primary variants may even be the same.

### Implementations

Implementations will be made in the following frameworks and framework versions:

* Vanilla JS ES2015
* React (latest stable)
* React (latest stable)
* React (latest stable) + [react-aria (latest stable)](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html)
* Vue (latest stable)
* Angular (latest stable)

All implementations will always use the same CSS file and test suite, as they most all appear and function identically.
